# Data Card: Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW)

---
## Dataset Summary
---
Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW) is a benchmark dataset for face verification, containing over 13,000 labeled face photographs collected from the web. Each image is labeled with the name of the person pictured. The dataset is designed for studying unconstrained face recognition and is widely used for evaluating face verification and recognition algorithms. The images are collected from news articles and other web sources, with the motivation to provide a challenging, real-world dataset for academic research. 

- **Benefits:** Standard benchmark for face verification and recognition.
- **Known issues:** Images are web-scraped and may contain labeling errors or duplicates.
- **Note:** *The dataset may not be fully representative of global demographics.*

## Sensitive Attributes
---

**Sensitivity Types:**  
- Identifiable Data  
- User Content (faces, names)

**Fields with Sensitive Data:**  
- `label`: Person's name (identifiable)  
- `image`: Face image (identifiable)
- `Gender, race, age`: not explicitly labeled, but visually present

**Security and Privacy Handling:**  
- Images are publicly available and collected from news sources.
- No explicit consent from individuals.
- Users are advised to use the dataset for research only and not for commercial purposes.

**Risk Types:**  
- Direct Risk (re-identification)  
- Indirect Risk (demographic bias)

**Risk Mitigation:**  
- Use for research only, not for commercial or sensitive applications.  
- Researchers should be aware of bias and report limitations.
  

**Note:** *No explicit annotation of sensitive attributes; analysis may require manual inspection.*
